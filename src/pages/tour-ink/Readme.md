A Tour and travel landing pages built with Gatsby and GraphQl (https://alfathmuqoddas.gatsby.io/tour-ink/)

## About This Project
This project is my attemp to create a nice looking landing page. I'm making this apps as a practice to sharpen my skills in replicating the design wireframe. I also want to sharpen my skill in developing React Apps.

## Technology Used
For building this project I'am using [Gatsby JS](https://gatsbyjs.com) a React framework for making static site and GraphQl to fetch data from json and display it to the apps. I also use vanilla css for some specific styling, [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for majority styling, [Lorem Picsum](https://picsum.photos/) for generating the photos in the website, and [Font-Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) for adding the icon and illustration in the page.
